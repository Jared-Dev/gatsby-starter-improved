# Maintainer Notes
Feature requests are always welcome! There are two recommended routes. You can submit a feature request along with a PR or you can submit the request to determine if it is likely to get merged before doing any work! Typically if the request doesn't hurt the near perfect Lighthouse score and doesn't remove any features, I'll likely get it merged in!

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
